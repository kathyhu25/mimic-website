  The derived concept mappings contain concepts collected from the clinical information system of both BIDMC and NMHC used within the ICU. Information covered includes vital signs, labs, procedures, and medications.

Standard terminology provides the foundation required for health information exchange and the ability to merge data from two disparate sources. The data dictionaries for mapping include vital signs, lab results, medications, and procedures. The concepts are mapped to the common terminology standards including Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) for vital signs and lab results, RxNorm for medications, and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for procedures including Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) codes. COVID related terms are also highlighted as part of the dictionary of terminologies, specifically for labs and medications.

Commonly occurring MIMIC and Northwestern labels associated with frequent events are mapped to standardized codes. Derived concept mappings for both MIMIC and Northwestern is released on the [MIMIC-Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code).
